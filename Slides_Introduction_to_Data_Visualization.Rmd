Data is not always clean  

Even if it is clean, Its never how we want it to be

Therefore we need to wrangle, transform or reshape it to a form that is useful to us.

_How to do that??_  

__`filter()`__  

__`mutate()`__  

__`group_by()` and `summarise()`__

__`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`__
